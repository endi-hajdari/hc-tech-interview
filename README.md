# Notion Link to Final Submission
For organizational purposes, the final solutions to Question 1 and Question 2 may be accessed via the following Notion site: https://curse-death-4db.notion.site/Housing-Cloud-Analytics-Engineer-Technical-Interview-b0cbe15370eb41eb9a697c5eae45e497?pvs=74. In the case where the link is broken or is not working, I have also uploaded all the relevant files to this repository.
